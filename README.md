<h1>This project demonstrates how to use a docker container to start a apache server.</h1>

<p>If you want to use docker you will need to download docker desktop and pull the image from docker hub.</p>

<p>Once the container is started you will need to create a docker compose file/yml.file to automate building the container.</p>

<p>After the docker compose file is created and the container is running you will need to test in the browser. You should get "its works" on the screen if the test is sucessful. You can change the index.html file in the htdocs folder to test.</p>
